# Library
Library - a personal book managing application made using HTML, CSS and Javascript for The Odin Project

## Features
- Add as many books you want, no limit
- Persistent data storage
- Update book status even after the book is already stored
- Delete a book anytime

## Learnings
- A simple thing but worth to note:
  - Everything in javascript is an object" &cross;
  - Except Primitives, everything in javascript is an object &check;
- Object [Nearly all objects are instances of Object, a typical object that inherits properties (including methods) from Object.prototype]
- object Constructors
- Prototype 
- Prototype Chain and Inheritance
- Object.create
- this keyword

## Roadmap
- Take input from the user on the number of pages read
- Sort books according to the status: Read or Not Read
- Display the total number of books read

### PS: Couple of issues which are to be worked upon later
- [x] Layout shift on changing book status
- [x] Large input text not handled 
- [ ] Use of book name as the key in localStorage
- [ ] Adding books directly into localStorage instead of putting all of them into an object and then adding that object to localStorage 
- [ ] Try to add functions into the object's prototype (not really an issue but just for the purpose of my own learning)
